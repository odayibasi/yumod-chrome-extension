Me as a person using Medium a lot, one of the biggest problem while reading a story of an author is that I am not able to access other stories written by the author quickly.

Thus, we considered developing a chrome extension for this particular case. The extension is ready to use. You can install extension using this link . If you like the story, we’d like you to share it so that people can try and benefit as well.
